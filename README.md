# QR Code Generator
 it will generate random qr-code by just writing text, name or giving url

 Api i used for qr code i copied from site called:
https://goqr.me/api/

There you will be able to see "Call the URL" and by copying this "https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=150x150&data=" and adding it into js it will be possible to generate random qr-code. Just make sure to get rid of "=Example" written at the end.
